#  Wordpress ClickStart

NOTE: This is experimental and may not work in your account. This is a proof of concept at this stage to show off PHP hosting but that is all.

Click on this to deploy this stack now:

## Notes:
The clickstart will install <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> automatically. All you need to do is to specify the administration credentials the first time you use your application and, optionally, subscribe for a SendGrid free or paid plan for email support. 

Then, you can commit changes to git, and they will be published automatically. Enjoy!
